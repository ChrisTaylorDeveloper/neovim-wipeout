# Neovim Wipeout

An attempt to remove all temporary files created by Neovim:

1. Run `./find`.
1. Manually convert the list of files in `find-results.txt` to a list of directories which you're happy to delete. For example, the contents of `RISKY-DELETE.SH`
1. At your own risk, run `RISKY-DELETE.sh`
