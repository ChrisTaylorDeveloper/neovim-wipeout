# Neovim Wipeout

An attempt to remove all temporary files created by Neovim.

## Notes

1. Run `./find` and then examine the contents of file `find-results.txt`
1. Manually convert the list of files in `find-results.txt` to a list of directories which you're happy to delete! For example, the contents of script `DELETE-DANGER.SH`
1. At your own risk, run `DELETE-DANGER.sh`
1. `DELETE-DANGER.sh` also removes two temporary files added by the LazyVim Starter project.
